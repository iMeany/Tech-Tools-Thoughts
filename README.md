# Tools-Tech-Thoughts

Tools, Technology and my Thoughts or experience with it.  

As a data scientist/architect, I need to use and learn about many tools, technologies, technique, libraries, etc. that can be useful. But as there is no one-size-fits-all solution, each has its strengths, weaknesses and optimal use cases. 
Here I write down some of my observations or experiences with the tools, to keep a record of the plethora of tools myself, and maybe someone else will find this useful.

## TODO:

- DuckDB
- Dash
- HiPlot
- InterpretML
- or-tools
- streamlit
- LLM UI tools (ollama)
- Rill
- Evidence
- AutoViz
- Polars
- DeepL
- PowerBI

### Maybe/once have some more experience

- Apache superset
- Hex.tech
- LanceDB, KuzuDB, DuckDB as a comparison
